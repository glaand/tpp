## Contribute to the development

If you want to dive deep and help with the development of TPP, install the project locally first according to our [Installation Guide] (https://github.com/tpportugal/tpp/blob/master/README.md). After that, we suggest you check the Issues on our [Issue Tracker] (https://github.com/tpportugal/tpp/issues) that are marked as' Good First Issue`. These issues are great for a smooth start and do not put you in front of the more complex parts of the system.

If you want to work on more challenging tasks, then follow the following markers: `data`,` feature`, `bug`. These issues have an overview and description of the intended. These kinds of Issues will be the ideal ones to start. That being said, these are not necessarily the easiest Issues.

### Testing

In order to ensure the functionality of the application, it is important to run several tests in the software to eliminate the possibility of logical errors.

* Each service will have a markdown file **TESTING.md** in their repository to explain how to test the service.

* Make sure the feature really solves the problem in question.

### Coding style

* Each service will have a markdown file **STYLING.md** in their repository to explain how to follow the coding style of the project.

### Introduction of your data in AUTHORS.md

## Contribute to data collection

With hundreds of public transport operators, we will also need your help in collecting data. Make sure the data collected is available to the public.

To contribute with timetables in format (PDF or JPG) you can access this link and fill out the form: https://www.tpp.pt/upload

### Obtaining data from operators in GTFS format

It is necessary to have a specification of data so that the integration and the maintenance of the data are efficient. You can read the document posted by Google on this [link](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference)

Not all companies, unfortunately, adhere to the idealism of **Open-Data**, this implies that there are bureaucracies in obtaining data. If you would like to contact the transport operators, please speak to one of the administrators: [glaand (André Glatzl)](mailto:andre@tpp.pt), [Rui-Santos (Rui J Santos)](mailto:rui@tpp.pt), [VitorSantos1 (Vítor Santos)](mailto:vitor@tpp.pt).
